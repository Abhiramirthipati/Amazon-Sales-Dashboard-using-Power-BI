### Key Notes

These are some of few points that I learnt from this project:
        
        1. The option "Use first row as headers", replaces the imported tables column titles with the entries of the first row in that table.
        2. Adding new measures in the data before starting the project will save a lot of time, because this measures will become handy in future.
        3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used Power BI, to perform data analysis and create calculations.
        4. Conditional formatting for adding active and inactive icons.
        5. Usage of Tooltips in Power BI.
